# For testing VictoriaMetrics vmalert
# https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/app/vmalert
#
# vmalert is a stateless component for executing recording and alerting rules
# against configured time series database which satisfies following requirements:
# * metrics ingestion via Prometheus remote write protocol
# * PromQL queries execution via /api/v1/query API handler
# In this test, vmalert can be used with Prometheus when `--web.enable-remote-write-receiver`
# is enabled.
#
# For the test suit the following requirements for vmalert should be satisfied:
# * run vmalert of version 1.76 or higher https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases
# * set flag `-rule.resendDelay=1m` to set delay for resending active alerts to 1m;
# * set flag `-datasource.queryTimeAlignment=false` to disable automatic `time` param;
#   alignments. See more about alignment here https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/pull/1257;
# * set flag `-disableAlertgroupLabel=true` to disable extra label of rule's group name;
# * set flag `-remoteWrite.maxBatchSize=1` to prevent vmalert from batching time series before
#   flushing to remote storage.
